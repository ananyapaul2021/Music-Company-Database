# Music-Company-Database
This is our 6th semester group project of the subject Database Management System.

We have created a database which stores all the basic details a Music Company should have from storing all sorts of songs their composers,producers,lyricist and so on. This database can be used in different platforms and one can easily implement it in their program through SQL embedding.

This repository includes all the documents related to this project from PPT, Term Paper, the various models namely EER(Extended Entity Model) and the Relational Model, Questions and their related solutions in the form of queries.

One might refer to our project and I hope you will find this useful.

Thanks to my team members :- Anurag Ganguly, Aniket Das and Anupam Chakraborty for their thorough participation and pulling out this project.
